Players take turns rolling a die.

They get 7 turns per round.

Each turn the player rolls until they say they want to stop or roll a one. Until then, their rolls add up.

Scores for each turn are totaled at the end of the round for that player.

The next player plays their round, then scores are compared and a winner declared.

Asks if you should play again.

Charts will be created to compare different simulations of strategy.
